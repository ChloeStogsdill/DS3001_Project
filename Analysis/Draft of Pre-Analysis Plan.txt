​​Pre-Analysis Plan
Research Question:
Can we accurately predict whether an email is phishing based on its content, metadata, and structural characteristics, and what indicators of phishing emails are evident based on the dataset?

Observations in the Study:
An observation in this study is a single email. Each email is represented as a row in the dataset, containing features such as its body text, subject line, sender, presence of URLs, and timestamp.

Supervised or Unsupervised Learning? Classification or Regression?
This study uses supervised learning because we have labeled data indicating whether an email is phishing (1) or not (0). The goal is to classify emails, making this a classification problem rather than regression.

Planned Models and Algorithms:
We will experiment with the following models-
Logistic Regression: As a simple yet effective classification approach, logistic regression will establish a baseline for performance.
Random Forest Classifier: This model can handle structured features like presence of URLs, email length, and sender frequency while reducing overfitting.
SVM with TF-IDF Vectorization: We will extract textual patterns from email bodies using TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features & use SVM to analyze textual features.

Evaluating Success:
The approach "works" if the model achieves high predictive accuracy without significant overfitting. Success will be measured using:
Accuracy: Overall classification correctness
Precision & Recall: Important for phishing detection since false negatives (missed phishing emails) are riskier than false positives
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall
ROC-AUC Score: Measures overall classifier performance
A high F1-score and AUC-ROC indicate a successful approach.

Anticipated Weaknesses & Contingency Plans:
Feature Engineering Challenges: Extracting meaningful features from text and URLs may be difficult. We will experiment with different NLP techniques.
Data Quality Issues: Inconsistent timestamps, missing values, or encoding errors in emails may require cleaning.
If our approach fails, we might discover that textual features alone are insufficient for classification, requiring a shift toward analyzing network-based features or metadata.
